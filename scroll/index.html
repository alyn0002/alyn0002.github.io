          BASIC INSTINCTS: HOW INSTAGRAM IS CHANGING THE WAY WE DECORATE OUR HOMES
        </div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Today’s interior-design trends are not the culmination of some artistic commentary on contemporary society like Constructivism or Art Nouveau. They are a reflection of the online spaces we’re conditioned to spend time in — aesthetics that look good on social media.If Postmodernism is the cultural logic of late capitalism, then Instagram is its apogee, a place where trends go to die, only to be reborn moments later. On platforms like Pinterest, once-rare images of over-designed loft spaces featuring cantilever chairs and low-slung leather sofas are scanned, uploaded, and funneled into Tumblr blogs and Instagram mood-board accounts like @__dreamspaces, @decorhardcore, and @casacalle_. In turn, these online curators create new desires for old aesthetics by turning reference photos into vessels for boosting engagement. Such accounts become producers, or rather, regurgitators of culture — inspiring consumers to mimic what they see online in their own homes as a means to earn likes. That’s why we see Mario Bellini’s bubbly, oversized Camaleonda sofa all over Instagram, and endless streams of teens lounging on knock-offs of Marcel Breuer’s Wassily chair on TikTok. In a hyper-visual world, the most relevant trends are those that stand out on a small screen.</p>

    Thanks to social media, collecting easily identifiable designer furniture, or replicas of it, is no longer a highbrow intellectual endeavor but an attention-seeking game that anyone can play. Click on any furniture-resale account in the greater New York area and you will find links to countless profiles hawking the same grammable goods: Spaghetti chairs by Giandomenico Belotti; Chiclet sofas by Ray Wilkes; Componibili storage units by Anna Castelli Ferrieri; and a seemingly infinite supply of Lucite Plia chairs by Giancarlo Piretti. For those who approach home decor from a purely aesthetic standpoint, the popularization of vintage furniture on Instagram has opened the door to design history, or at least the idea that furniture can retain value and intellectual significance beyond its functionality. For the average consumer, Instagram furniture resellers offer an appealing alternative to the numbifying aesthetics found at contemporary retailers like West Elm or CB2. But for those who consider themselves experts in the field, this so-called democratization of taste has destructive potential. Not only do vintage dealers hawking Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer make items from certain designers more expensive and harder to source, they also, according to aspiring gatekeepers, threaten the relevance of lesser-known designers altogether.</p>

    I have friends in their mid-20s who act as if they discovered 80s Postmodernism long before anyone on Instagram did. They curse the rising costs of vases made by Czech designers and mock those willing to pay exorbitant prices to vintage dealers for chairs by Gaetano Pesce. Similar critiques of design newbies proliferate in tweets and memes that point to the increasing ubiquity of Cesca chairs (Breuer again) and selfie-friendly Ultrafragola mirrors (Ettore Sottsass) found on the feeds of models and influencers. These memes, accessible to anyone who spends time looking at interiors on Instagram, elicit elitism, but they also make those with minimal design knowledge feel as if they too are in-the-know. All of this has led to a democratization of design history (the more posts, the more awareness), while enabling the masses, regardless of their economic status, to poke fun at the poor taste of celebrities and their peers (lest we forget Gigi Hadid’s self-designed New York apartment, or Kimye’s monochromatic McMansion). The result is a confused mish-mash of design-adjacent people competitively one-upping each other online, leading to a thirst for obscure gems from yesteryear, and an increase in gatekeeping surrounding design and curatorial practices<p>

          In today’s hypervisual world, it’s almost foolish to claim originality on any given creative endeavor. Not only is almost all art and design built on references, but, in the age of Instagram, most of the references we see are the same. For some, this is a call to work harder, to log off the Internet and find more obscure books to scan, or at the very least to take special care to give credit to those who inspire your work. But for a younger generation who have grown up with the Internet and social media as their main, if not only, creative resource, it’s not originality that counts but curation, and whether something looks good on the feed. It’s the reason why gen-Z TikTokers don’t care whether or not the Wassily chair they’re lounging on to sho
