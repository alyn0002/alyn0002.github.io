        BASIC INSTINCTS: HOW INSTAGRAM IS CHANGING THE WAY WE DECORATE OUR HOMES
By Taylore Scarabelli

Today’s interior-design trends are not the culmination of some artistic commentary on contemporary society like Constructivism or Art Nouveau. They are a reflection of the online spaces we’re conditioned to spend time in — aesthetics that look good on social media.If Postmodernism is the cultural logic of late capitalism, then Instagram is its apogee, a place where trends go to die, only to be reborn moments later. On platforms like Pinterest, once-rare images of over-designed loft spaces featuring cantilever chairs and low-slung leather sofas are scanned, uploaded, and funneled into Tumblr blogs and Instagram mood-board accounts like @__dreamspaces, @decorhardcore, and @casacalle_
