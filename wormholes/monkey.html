     I'm not sure where the myth that monkeys eat bananas started — I personally suspect <a class="curious" href="curious george.html">Curious George</a>— but it's time for it to stop. <br> <br>
     Wild monkeys don't eat them. <br> <br> "The entire wild monkey-banana connection in fact is total fabrication," Katharine Milton, who has studied the diets of primates for decades, told Tech Insider. "The edible banana is a cultivated domesticated plant and fruit. <br> <br> Wild monkeys never encounter bananas at all ever unless they are around human habitation where bananas are or have been planted." <br> <br> Monkeys do eat fruits, but they wouldn't encounter bananas like we could get at the grocery store in the forest. They also eat leaves, flowers, nuts, and insects in the wild.
